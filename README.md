# Car-Parking-System-Using-Verilog

This is a simple car parking project using verilog and it is done on basis of finite state 
machines and it includes a concpet that every vechile has to enter a passowrd to enter and as well as exit and 
assigned to STOP if it has been allocated to park at a slot. And with small changes we can modify this code to
count no of vechiles entered or exited from a parking slot.
